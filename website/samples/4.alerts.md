> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

## Rich Content

> [!NOTE]

>
> They can also contain multiple paragraphs.

> [!TIP]
> You can include lists:
>
> - First item
> - Second item
> - Third item

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Code blocks work too:

> ```

## Custom Types
