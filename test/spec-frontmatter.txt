# Frontmatter

With the flag `MD_FLAG_FRONTMATTER`, MD4X enables recognition of YAML-style
frontmatter blocks delimited by `---` at the very beginning of the document.

The frontmatter block must start with a line of three or more dashes as the
very first line of the document.

```````````````````````````````` example
---
title: Hello
date: 2024-01-01
---
.
<x-frontmatter>title: Hello
date: 2024-01-01
</x-frontmatter>
````````````````````````````````

The content after the closing fence is parsed normally.

```````````````````````````````` example
---
title: Hello
---
Hello, world!
.
<x-frontmatter>title: Hello
</x-frontmatter>
<p>Hello, world!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Empty frontmatter is allowed.

```````````````````````````````` example
---
---
.
<x-frontmatter></x-frontmatter>
````````````````````````````````

More than three dashes can be used.

```````````````````````````````` example
-----
title: Hello
-----
.
<x-frontmatter>title: Hello
</x-frontmatter>
````````````````````````````````

Trailing spaces after dashes are allowed.

```````````````````````````````` example
---
title: Hello
---
.
<x-frontmatter>title: Hello
</x-frontmatter>
````````````````````````````````

Frontmatter must be on the very first line. A leading blank line disables it.

```````````````````````````````` example

---
title: Hello
---
.
<hr>
<h2>title: Hello</h2>
````````````````````````````````

Frontmatter is not recognized without the flag. The `---` lines are parsed
as thematic breaks instead.

```````````````````````````````` example
---
title: Hello
---
.
<x-frontmatter>title: Hello
</x-frontmatter>
````````````````````````````````

If the frontmatter is not closed, the rest of the document is consumed as
frontmatter content.

```````````````````````````````` example
---
title: Hello
date: 2024-01-01
.
<x-frontmatter>title: Hello
date: 2024-01-01
</x-frontmatter>
````````````````````````````````

The closing fence must not have any non-space content after the dashes.

```````````````````````````````` example
---
title: Hello
--- not a closing fence
---
.
<x-frontmatter>title: Hello
--- not a closing fence
</x-frontmatter>
````````````````````````````````

Frontmatter cannot appear after other content.

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello
---
title: value
---
.
<h2>Hello</h2>
<h2>title: value</h2>
````````````````````````````````

Frontmatter cannot be indented.

```````````````````````````````` example
  ---
title: Hello
---
.
<hr>
<h2>title: Hello</h2>
````````````````````````````````

Frontmatter cannot appear inside a container block.

```````````````````````````````` example
> ---
> title: Hello
> ---
.
<blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>title: Hello</h2>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````
